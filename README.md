## Overview
This is an iPhone app that visualizes the Caltrain system in real time (or at least an optimistic version of it based on the published time tables.)  It was motivated by my 2.5 year old daughter, who loved seeing the trains go by.  Every morning, as we would drive next to the tracks, she would ask me when the next one would come, and short of thumbing through the many timetable apps, I had no idea.  Caltrain Spotter lets you see at a glance when the next one is coming.

## //TODO

* Incorporate the real time API so that the trains can be adjusted accordingly.
* Expand to other train systems.
